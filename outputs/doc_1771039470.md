The Data Integration component utilizes a combination of JSON-based data structures and a relational database schema to store genomic data. The JSON structure is employed for storing metadata and small-scale data, while the relational database schema is used for storing large-scale genomic data.

**JSON Structure**
The JSON structure is designed to store metadata, such as sample information, experiment details, and data provenance. The structure consists of the following key-value pairs:

* `sample_id`: Unique identifier for each sample
* `experiment_id`: Unique identifier for each experiment
* `data_type`: Type of data stored (e.g., sequencing, array, etc.)
* `data_provenance`: Information about data origin, processing, and quality control

**Database Schema**
The relational database schema is designed to store large-scale genomic data, including sequencing data, array data, and other types of genomic information. The schema consists of the following tables:

* `samples`: Stores information about each sample, including sample ID, experiment ID, and data type
* `experiments`: Stores information about each experiment, including experiment ID, sample IDs, and data type
* `data`: Stores large-scale genomic data, including sequencing data, array data, and other types of genomic information
* `provenance`: Stores information about data origin, processing, and quality control

**Memory Management**
The Data Integration component utilizes a combination of in-memory data structures and disk-based storage to manage large-scale genomic data. The in-memory data structures are designed to optimize data retrieval and processing, while the disk-based storage ensures data persistence and scalability.

**Data Integration Process**
The data integration process involves the following steps:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Large-scale genomic data is ingested from various sources, including sequencing platforms, array platforms, and other data providers.
2. **Data Processing**: Data is processed to ensure data quality, format consistency, and data integrity.
3. **Data Storage**: Processed data is stored in the JSON structure and relational database schema.
4. **Data Retrieval**: Researchers can retrieve data from the unified view of genetic information, using the JSON structure and relational database schema.

By seamlessly integrating large-scale genomic data from various sources, the Data Integration component enables researchers to access a unified view of genetic information, facilitating breakthroughs in genomics research and personalized medicine.
